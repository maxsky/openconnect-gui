# Building release version and create a package 

## Version scheme

and main programming activities are in 'main' or 'feature/*' branches.
Version string auto=generated on compilation from Git info into following format:

    <major>.<minor>.<patch>[-rev_count-sha1][-dirty]

## Building packages

Always check if you have committed all changes or move work-in-progress work into stash!!
Following steps illustrate how to create application:

    $ git clone https://gitlab.com/openconnect/openconnect-gui
    $ cd openconnect-gui

To build a release package, review released changes in `CHANGELOG.md`,
update planned release version in `CMakeLists.txt`, commit and start a release
process with target tag:

    $ git checkout main
    $ ./release.sh vX.Y.Z

Note that this requires to have a gitlab token with permissions to release
at ~/.gitlab-token as well as the necessary credentials for
casper.infradead.org.


### Release details

The release script takes care of
 - Creating a tag
 - Building released packages on gitlab CI
 - Uploading the packages to casper.infradead.org
 - Creating a gitlab release
 - Copying the relevant changelong entries to release description
